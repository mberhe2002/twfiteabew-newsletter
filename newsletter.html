      We give thanks to God for your love, your prayers, and your offering for the work of Twfite Abew.

    <h2>Service in the Spirit of Our Tradition</h2>
    <p>
      Since March 2025, our Felege Hiwot centers have continued uplifting young souls through Church teaching,
      fellowship, and practical support. By God’s grace, we have supported this work with close to <strong>2 million Birr</strong>,
      strengthening the learning environment and supporting both students and teachers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Key progress during this period includes:
      supporting the hiring of a <strong>full-time project manager</strong>, celebrating the graduation of <strong>five students</strong>
      from Axum Tsion School, supporting apostolic service in remote areas of Maichew, and sponsoring specialized training
      for displaced priests in Western Tigray.

    <p>
    Memhir Tsegazeab is a devoted spiritual teacher serving the Orthodox Christian community in Maichew and a graduate of New Testament Studies from a Felege Hiwot program supported by Twfite Abew. He teaches Sunday School, guides believers through  <strong>ማይ ፀሎት</strong>, and offers pastoral care marked by humility, patience, and hope. Many spiritual fellowship groups (<strong>ፅዋዕ ማሕበር</strong>) seek his guidance, and he also mentors current Felege Hiwot students, helping them grow as future teachers and preachers. For the past six months, Twfite Abew has supported his ministry, enabling him to reach more people and serve his community more effectively. His faithful service continues to strengthen spiritual life in Maichew and inspire many within the Church.
    </p>

    <h2>What’s Next</h2>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, we are preparing the next phase of this work with care and prayer. Our priorities include:
      planning another fundraising effort, launching more sustainable support initiatives, and continuing the Felege Hiwot support.
      We also plan to sponsor specialized training for both students and teachers to strengthen learning, discipleship, and service.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we continue this sacred work, we face rising expenses for basic supplies, meals, educational materials, and transportation.
      We kindly ask for your continued support and prayers—may God strengthen the children, protect the teachers, and make a way for
      every need to be met.
